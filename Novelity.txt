NOVEL FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM

- Failure-Aware Automation
The system tracks failed automated recovery actions and avoids repeating the same actions for similar incident patterns in the future, preventing repeated ineffective or harmful remediation attempts.

- Safety-Bounded Responses
Automated recovery actions operate within predefined safety limits such as retry thresholds, cooldown periods, and protected services, ensuring automation does not introduce additional system instability.

- Incident-Centric Design
Failures are modeled as stateful incidents with controlled lifecycle stages rather than simple alert groupings, enabling consistent tracking, escalation, and resolution.

- Context-Aware Playbook Selection
Response playbooks are selected based on incident severity, priority, correlation context, and execution history rather than relying solely on individual alert types.

- Simulation-Based Validation
Synthetic logs and simulated failure scenarios are used to validate detection logic and response workflows before deployment, reducing risk during real incidents.

- Human-in-the-Loop Escalation
High-risk recovery actions and failed automation attempts are automatically escalated to on-call engineers, ensuring human oversight where automated decisions may be unsafe.

- Separation of Orchestration and Actuation
Incident response decision logic is decoupled from execution mechanisms, improving system safety, maintainability, and extensibility.

- Audit-First Design
All incidents, automated actions, manual approvals, and failures are recorded to provide full traceability, support debugging, and enable post-incident analysis.
