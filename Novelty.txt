NOVELTY OF THE PROJECT
---------------------

1. Log-Driven Automated Incident Response
Traditional monitoring systems primarily rely on metrics and alerts, treating logs as passive diagnostic data. This project goes beyond monitoring by treating application logs as first-class control signals for automated incident creation and recovery actions. The system forms a closed feedback loop from detection to resolution.

2. Cross-Service Incident Correlation
The system correlates log events across multiple services within defined time windows to identify system-level incidents. This helps in detecting cascading failures rather than isolated service errors.

3. Hybrid Failure Detection Approach
The project combines rule-based detection for known failure patterns with anomaly-based detection for unknown or rare behaviors. This dual detection strategy balances precision for known failures with adaptability to previously unseen system behaviors.

4. Safety-Aware Automated Recovery
Automated recovery actions are executed with safety mechanisms such as retry limits, cooldown periods, and manual approval for high-risk operations. This prevents unstable or unsafe automated behavior.

5. Structured Incident Lifecycle Management
Each detected incident follows a well-defined lifecycle: Open, In Progress, and Resolved. Incident severity is dynamically assigned based on error frequency, service impact, and correlation confidence.

6. Auditable and Explainable Automation
All incidents, automated actions, failures, and escalations are logged and stored. This ensures transparency, accountability, and ease of debugging, which is critical for production-grade systems.

One-Line Novelty Statement:
This project introduces a log-driven, safety-aware automated incident response system that correlates distributed failures across services and executes controlled recovery actions with full auditability.
