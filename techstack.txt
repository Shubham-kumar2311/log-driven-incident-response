TECH STACK OF THE PROJECT
------------------------

1. Log Ingestion Layer
- Fluent Bit
  Used for lightweight and efficient log shipping from application services.
- Apache Kafka (Optional)
  Used for buffering and decoupling log producers and consumers in scalable deployments.

2. Log Processing and Normalization
- Python
  Used for log parsing, normalization, and enrichment.
- Regular Expressions and JSON Parsing
  Used to process unstructured and semi-structured logs.
- Pydantic
  Used to enforce a common internal log schema.

3. Failure Detection and Correlation Engine
- Rule-Based Detection
  Configurable detection rules defined using JSON or YAML.
- Anomaly-Based Detection
  Statistical techniques such as moving averages, thresholds, or z-score analysis.
- Scikit-learn (Optional)
  Used for lightweight anomaly detection models like Isolation Forest.

4. Incident Management Module
- FastAPI
  Backend framework for incident APIs and lifecycle management.
- PostgreSQL
  Persistent storage for incidents, logs, and audit data.
- SQLAlchemy
  ORM for database interaction.

5. Automated Response Engine
- Python
  Executes automated recovery workflows.
- YAML-Based Playbooks
  Maps incident types to recovery actions.
- Docker SDK
  Used for restarting services or managing containers.
- Shell Scripts
  Used for deployment rollback and system-level recovery actions.

6. Dashboard and Notifications
- React.js
  Web-based user interface for monitoring incidents and system status.
- Chart.js / Recharts
  Visualization of incidents and trends.
- Email / Webhooks
  Notification and escalation mechanisms.

7. Security and Authentication
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
  Used for authentication and authorization.
- Role-Based Access Control
  Supports different user roles such as admin, operator, and viewer.

8. Deployment and Infrastructure
- Docker
  Containerization of system components.
- Docker Compose
  Local and academic deployment orchestration.
- Linux
  Target operating system for deployment.

9. Monitoring and Health Checks
