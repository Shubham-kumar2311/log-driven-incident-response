Logs as the Primary Source of Insight
Most monitoring systems focus heavily on metrics and alerts. This project takes a different approach by treating application logs as the main source of information. By analyzing raw logs directly, the system is able to capture richer context about failures without requiring additional instrumentation in services.

Understanding Failures Across Services
In real-world systems, a single issue often affects multiple services. This project correlates log events from different services within specific time windows to identify related failures and group them into a single incident. This helps reduce alert noise and provides a clearer picture of what is actually going wrong.

Combining Known Rules with Adaptive Detection
The system uses both rule-based detection for known error patterns and anomaly-based analysis to identify unusual behavior. This combination allows it to handle expected failures while also adapting to new or previously unseen issues.

Confidence-Based Incident Severity
Instead of treating all detected issues equally, the system assigns a confidence score to each incident based on factors such as error frequency, severity, and cross-service correlation. This score helps determine how serious an incident is and how it should be handled.

Safe and Responsible Automation
While automation can reduce downtime, uncontrolled automated actions can be risky. This project introduces safety mechanisms such as retry limits, cooldown periods, and manual approvals for high-risk actions. This ensures that automation improves reliability rather than introducing new failures.

Configurable Recovery Playbooks
Recovery actions are organized using predefined playbooks that can be updated without changing the system code. This makes the system flexible and easier to adapt to different environments or evolving operational requirements.

Complete Incident Lifecycle Management
The system manages incidents from detection to resolution through clearly defined lifecycle states. All actions and decisions are logged, providing a complete audit trail that is useful for debugging, analysis, and learning from past incidents.

Bridging Theory and Practice
This project combines software engineering principles taught in academia with real-world incident response practices. It serves both as a learning platform and as a practical prototype for automated reliability management in distributed systems.
