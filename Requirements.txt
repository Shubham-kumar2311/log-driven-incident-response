1. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
  - Ingest unstructured and semi-structured logs from multiple application services and infrastructure components in real time.
  - Support log ingestion using external log shippers and streaming pipelines. (FluentBit)
  -	Parse and normalize incoming logs into a common internal format to enable unified analysis and correlation.
  -	Parse like service name, timestamp, severity level, error type, and contextual metadata.
  - Detect anomalies and failure patterns using rule-based and statistical analysis techniques.
  - Send unsolvable error to human via notification or mail.
  - Automatically create and manage incident records with lifecycle states including Open, In Progress, and Resolved.
  - Correlate related log events across services and defined time windows to identify incidents.
  - Maintain logs of all incidents, automated actions, and failures for auditing and debugging.
  - Assign incident severity based on error frequency, impact, and correlation confidence.
  - Enforce safety mechanisms including retry limits and cooldown periods for automated actions.
  - Escalate incidents to human operators when automated recovery actions fail.

2. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
  - No latency, highly available
  - reliable buffering and replay of logs for reprocessing and analysis
  - maintain version history for detection rules, response playbooks, and configuration changes.
  - Ensure reliability and fault tolerance during partial system failures.
  - Minimize performance overhead on application services generating logs.
  - Process logs with near real-time latency suitable for production environments.
  - Support scaling to handle increasing log volume and number of monitored services.
  - Protect system data using appropriate security measures.
  - Provide basic monitoring of system health and processing status.
  
3. SYSTEM AND DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS
  - deployable in cloud-based, containerized, or on-premise environments.
  - Provide a web-based interface for viewing incidents and system status.
  - support microservices-based architectures and container orchestration platforms.
  - Integrate with log shippers and external tools through standard interfaces.
  - Support backup and recovery of incident data and configuration.
  - Support secure user authentication.
