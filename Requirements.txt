1) FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
  --------------------------
  - Ingest unstructured and semi-structured logs from multiple application services and infrastructure components in real time.
  - Support log ingestion using external log shippers and streaming pipelines. (FluentBit/FileBit)
  -	Parse and normalize incoming logs into a common internal format to enable unified analysis and correlation.
  -	Parse key attributes such as service name, timestamp, severity level, error type, and contextual metadata.
  - Detect anomalies and failure patterns using rule-based and statistical analysis techniques.
  - Correlate related log events across different services and timeframes to identify root causes of failures.
  - Send unsolvable error to human via notification or mail.
  - Automatically create and manage incident records with lifecycle states including Open, In Progress, and Resolved.
  - Assign incident severity based on error frequency, impact, and correlation confidence.
  - Support configurable response playbooks that map incident types to automated and manual recovery actions.
  - Support automated response actions to remediate detected issues, such as restarting services or scaling resources.
  - Execute automated recovery actions such as service restarts, deployment rollbacks, or resource scaling.
  - Enforce safety mechanisms including retry limits and cooldown periods for automated actions.
  - Require manual approval for high-risk recovery actions.
  - Notify users when incidents are created, updated, or resolved via email, SMS, or messaging platforms.
  - Maintain logs of all incidents, automated actions, and failures for auditing and debugging.
  - Escalate incidents to human operators when automated recovery actions fail.

2) NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
  -----------------------------
  - Near real-time processing with high availability.
  - Reliable buffering and replay of logs for reprocessing and analysis
  - Maintain version history for detection rules, response playbooks, and configuration changes.
  - Ensure reliability and fault tolerance during partial system failures.
  - Minimize performance overhead on application services generating logs.
  - Allow updates to detection rules and response playbooks without system downtime.
  - Protect sensitive log data through encryption at rest and in transit, along with role-based access controls.
  - Process logs with near real-time latency suitable for production environments.
  - Support scaling to handle increasing log volume and number of monitored services.
  - Ensure predictable performance under peak log ingestion loads.
  - Provide basic monitoring of system health and processing status.
  
3) SYSTEM AND DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS
  --------------------------------------
  - Deployable in cloud-based, containerized, or on-premise environments.
  - Provide a web-based interface for viewing incidents and system status.
  - Support microservices-based architectures and container orchestration platforms.
  - Integrate with log shippers and external tools through standard interfaces.
  - Use persistent storage for logs, incident data, and configuration information.
  - Support secure authentication and authorization mechanisms for system access.
  - Support backup and recovery of incident data and configuration.
