1. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
  - Ingest unstructured and semi-structured logs from multiple application services and infrastructure components in real time.
  - Support log ingestion using external log shippers and streaming pipelines. (FluentBit)
  -	Parse and normalize incoming logs into a common internal format to enable unified analysis and correlation.
  -	Parse like service name, timestamp, severity level, error type, and contextual metadata.
  - Detect anomalies and failure patterns using rule-based and statistical analysis techniques.
  - Send unsolvable error to human via notification or mail.

2. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
  - No latency, highly available
  - reliable buffering and replay of logs for reprocessing and analysis
  - maintain version history for detection rules, response playbooks, and configuration changes.

3. SYSTEM AND DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS
